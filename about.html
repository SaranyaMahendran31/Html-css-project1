<h1>2. Check the Weather Conditions</h1>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Before heading out, always check the weather forecast. Sledding in heavy snowfall or during a blizzard can reduce visibility and increase the risk of accidents.

<h1>3. Use Proper Equipment</h1>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Ensure you have the appropriate equipment for sledding. Choose a sled that is sturdy and stable, with a low center of gravity. Avoid using makeshift sleds or objects such as trays or cardboard boxes, as they may not provide enough control or protection. Don’t forget to wear a helmet to protect your head from any potential impact.</p>

<h1>4. Dress Appropriately</h1>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Dressing in layers is essential to protect yourself from the cold temperatures. Wear thermal or moisture-wicking base layers to keep your body warm and dry. Layer up with a insulating mid-layer, such as a fleece or down jacket, and top it off with a waterproof outer layer to keep you protected from snow and wind. Don’t forget to wear warm socks, gloves, and a hat to keep your extremities from getting too cold.</p>

<h1>5. Follow Proper Sledding Techniques</h1>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">When sledding, sit or lay down on your sled with your feet facing forward. Hold on firmly to the sled’s handles or sides and keep your arms and legs inside the sled at all times while going down the hill. Avoid attempting dangerous stunts or maneuvers that can cause loss of control or injury.</p>
